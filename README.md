I would like to see a list of all sites I have saved on my homepage.

As a user,
So that I can quickly find web sites I recently bookmarked,
I would like to see links in descending chronological order.

As a user,
So that I can keep building on my collection of sites,
I would like to be able to add sites to this list.

As a user,
So that I can note the particular categories these sites belong to,
I would like to be able to tag the sites that I save.

As a user,
So that I can later retrieve sites in a certain category,
I would like to be able to filter the list of sites by tag.
